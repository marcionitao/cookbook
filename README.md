So for every problem there is a solution, such as a revenue kitchen: to achieve a goal given to solve their problem,
there is often a direct solution, i.e., a set of steps leading to a given target.

For this, the project My Cookbook is to make the management of these "recipes" and it's easy to look the same when you
have a determiner problem at hand.
